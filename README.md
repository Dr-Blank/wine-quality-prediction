# Wine Quality Prediction

Data set used for this project is **Wine Quality** dataset from UCI Repository ([link here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)).

1. [Marks: 10] Explain what problem you are going to solve using this dataset. Provide a brief overview of your problem statement. [Discuss your problem statement with your
TAs if they approve then you can proceed with the next steps.]
2. [Marks: 15] Explain your dataset. Explore your dataset and provide at least 5 meaningful charts/graphs with explanation.
3. [Marks: 15] Do data cleaning/pre-processing as required and explain what you have done for your dataset and why?
4. [Marks: 20] Implement 2 machine learning models, explain which algorithms you have selected and why. Compare them and show success metrics (Accuracy/RMSE/Confusion Matrix) as per your problem. Explain results.
5. [Marks: 20] Deploy a run time pipeline for your dataset using Azure Designer Studio.
Or Do hyperparameter tuning for your algorithms. Explain your results. Or Use Automated ML for your data set. Explain best model results.
