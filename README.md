# Wine Quality Prediction

Problem Statement: Construct a predictive model that uses the physiochemical characteristics to determine the wine's quality.
Overview: We are using two datasets that are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The output is based on sensory data, which is the median of at least three expert wine assessments. The inputs are physical-chemical data, such as PH levels. Each expert gave the wine a score between 0 (very poor) and 10 (outstanding) (excellent). We are going to build a machine learning model to determine the wine's quality based on the physiochemical characteristics.

Data set used for this project is **Wine Quality** dataset from UCI Repository ([link here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)).
